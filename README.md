# Gumi Industrial Energy Consumption Competition

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting energy consumption for various buildings and factories within the Gumi National Industrial Complex, Korea. The goal is to advance research in industrial energy analytics and support initiatives for smarter, more sustainable facilities.

## Project Overview

- **Datasets:**  
  This repository contains CSV files from different sites (such as B-dong, Hanwha, and Building A cafeteria) that record real-world energy use in industrial environments.

- **Analysis Notebooks:**  
  Jupyter Notebooks provide code for exploring, cleaning, visualizing, and modeling the data. They benchmark machine learning approaches to predict energy consumption and analyze influential factors.

## Key Objectives

- Understand energy consumption trends across sites and time periods.
- Build predictive models for short-term and long-term industrial energy demand.
- Extract interpretable insights that support smart industry and low-carbon goals.

## Applications

- Benchmarking and optimizing energy efficiency in industrial complexes.
- Informing facility management and urban infrastructure planning.
- Advancing research in sustainable manufacturing and smart city development.

## Credits

- Data sourced from the Gumi National Industrial Complex, Korea.
- Project inspired by ongoing developments in energy informatics and industrial AI.
